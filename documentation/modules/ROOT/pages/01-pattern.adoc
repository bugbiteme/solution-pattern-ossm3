== The story behind this solution pattern

**Canary Deployment with Traffic Splitting**

**Objective**: Safely roll out a new version of a microservice while monitoring its performance.

A retail company has an application running on OpenShift that handles online orders. The development team wants to deploy a new version (v2) of their hello-service without disrupting users of the current version (v1).


== The Solution

Using OpenShift Service Mesh 3 with the Kubernetes Gateway API, they configure a traffic-splitting policy to direct 90% of traffic to v1 and 10% to v2.

With integrated observability tools like Jaeger and Kiali, the team monitors traffic flow, latency, and error rates in real-time for v2.

Once performance metrics confirm stability, they incrementally increase traffic to v2 until it handles 100% of requests, ensuring a smooth transition.
